            <h3 class="c0"><a name="h.ds2lpr96u4dm"></a><span class="c3">Website Visitors</span></h3>

            <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Like most website operators, SkillCafe collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. SkillCafe&rsquo;s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how SkillCafe&rsquo;s visitors use its website. From time to time, SkillCafe may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</span>
            </p>

            <h3 class="c0"><a name="h.mg3nt6u0htmh"></a><span class="c3">Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</span></h3>

            <p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p>

            <p class="c8"><span class="c10 c11">SkillCafe also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users. </span><span
                    class="c1">Certain visitors to SkillCafe&rsquo;s websites choose to interact with SkillCafe in ways that require SkillCafe to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that SkillCafe gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with SkillCafe &ndash;
                to search and apply for jobs, for example &ndash; are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, SkillCafe collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor&rsquo;s interaction with SkillCafe. SkillCafe does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</span>
            </p>

            <h3 class="c0"><a name="h.cdio6yvyvvw3"></a><span class="c3">Aggregated Statistics</span></h3>

            <p class="c2"><span class="c1">SkillCafe may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, SkillCafe may monitor the most clicked jobs in their site. SkillCafe may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, SkillCafe does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</span>

                    class="c3">Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</span></h3>

            <p class="c2"><span class="c1">SkillCafe discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors, affiliated organizations and recruiters that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on SkillCafe&rsquo;s behalf or to provide services available at SkillCafe&rsquo;s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using SkillCafe&rsquo;s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. SkillCafe will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, SkillCafe discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when SkillCafe believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of SkillCafe, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an SkillCafe website and have supplied your email address, SkillCafe may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what&rsquo;s going on with SkillCafe and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. SkillCafe takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</span>

            <p class="c2"><span class="c1">A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor&rsquo;s computer, and that the visitor&rsquo;s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns.

            <p class="c2"><span class="c1">If SkillCafe, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that SkillCafe goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of SkillCafe may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</span>
